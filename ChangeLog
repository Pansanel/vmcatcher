hepixvmilsubscriber-0.1.4

* vmlisub_cache changed default behaviour to not check integrity of already downloaded 
    images. This is still possible using a command line option but no longer default.
* Added vmlisub_endorser to main package, so endorsers can be managed directly. Please 
    see README for full details.
* vmlisub_endorser now works with current database schema, and changed command line to 
    be moreconistent with other applications in this suite.
* vmlisub_sub now has more error return codes to allow test suite to check for errors.
        10 failed to download image list.
        11 failed to validate image list.
        12 metadata and certificate dont match.
        13 Endorser not authorised on subscription.
        14 trust anchor missing
        15 Database integrity error.
        31 imagelist dc:identifier invalid.
        32 image dc:identifier invalid.
* vmlisub_sub no longer by default adds endorser when subscribing to a imagelist. Old 
    behaviour can be restored with the --auto-endorse option.
* vmlisub_sub Now handles cleanly the exception of imagelists being unavailable.
* vmlisub_sub Errors with registering or failing to register endorsers has better logging.
* Spelling corrections on command line help.

* Added this Changelog file.

hepixvmilsubscriber-0.1.1

* Better documentation 
* Fix an uncaught exception for failing to verify messages.

hepixvmilsubscriber-0.1.0

* Data base schema has changed adding a new table ImageDefinition and 
   renaming or tables and field for constancy reasons.
* Images are now selected to be cached. (reason 1 for new table)
    '-a', '--add' and '-r', '--remove' options added to vmlisub_image.
* When subscribing to an image list the imagelists images UUID's are 
    registered to the subscription, all UUID's that clash in a later 
    added subscriptions will be ignored. All image UUID's that are not 
    registered for a subscription will be ignored, and an error message
    will be logged. (reason 2 for new table)
* New format of cache.index files. Allowing better tracking of images 
    without accessing DB. (old format had issues with expiring images)
* Made a class for each cache directory, inheriting from a base class.
    (easier maintenance)
* Clearly logging all defaulted command line values. 
    (hopefully easier to use/support.)
* Allowing cache management to do separate tasks of downloading, 
    check sum testing and expiring. 
    (You might want to check the check sums more frequently)
* Renamed the default database from "tutorial.db" to
    "vmilsubscriber.db" (To avoid people trying to use old DB with new
    code).
* Renamed "image.dc:identifier" field on image queries to 
    "imagedef.dc:identifier" as this is in my opinion more clear.
* Removed "imagelist.authorised" from image queries as it was
    misleading.
* Added 'imagedef.cache' to image queries so you know if image is
    cached.
* Added more information to image information including,
    'image.dc:description', 'image.dc:title', 'image.hv:hypervisor',
    'image.hv:size', 'image.hv:uri', 'image.hv:version', 'image.sl:arch',
    'image.sl:checksum', 'image.sl:comments', 'image.sl:os',
    'image.sl:osversion' This is to make image selection easier.
* Removed 'sha512' from general image listing as images may not be
    available so may not have a current hash, you can still find an image
    UUID by 'sha512'.
* Fixed bug about expiring images immediately rather than on second
    DB update.
* Changed 'imagelist.authorised' to 'imagelist.expired' for
    subscription queries, as previous title was misleading.
* Images listing now shows all images assigned to a subscription, 
    rather than available images, images now have a state number, this 
    is a bitmask in a way similar to directory permissions in UNIX.
    1 == should be cached. 2 == Available, hence images with status 3 
    will be cached.

hepixvmilsubscriber-0.0.15

* Changes to handle differences in python 2.4 (SL5) and python 2.6
    (SL6) url parsing libraries.
* Cleaner error handling and spelling correction stating clearly if the
    file fails to verify, by size or sha512, rather than always stating size.

hepixvmilsubscriber-0.0.14

* Improved error message when images pass disk space limit.
* Support https as a image download format (being used by CERN VM).
* Catch exception correctly for corrupted signed images lists.

hepixvmilsubscriber-0.0.13

* More robust to image lists with data that does not pass
  validation. No new features have been added.
